                    <p>Have you ever been in a situation where you think so much and do nothing? The huge difference between entrepreneur and wantrepreneur is whether you start and whether you do. Everyone has dreams; we don’t compete on who has better dreams. We compete on who jump out of the bed and work on something they are passionate about. That’s what makes us entrepreneurs.</p>

Should I put it in Tabung Haji with stable dividend, or put my money in stocks? Should I buy my house first or not? And, if I buy a house, is it for me to live, or to rent to others? There are too many options and what should I do? Diversify. </p>

                        <p>“I don’t understand, it looks like everything is similar.” In the Quran, Allah says, “Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, ‘Trade is [just] like interest.’ But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest.” Before talking about growing our money, make sure our money is pure from unlawful sources. Let’s dig more into it in MyNext.</p>
