                <p>MyNext is a 2-day event targeted for Malaysian students in North America that is aimed to produce students with business aspirations, students with deep knowledge enough to invest and be involved in real estate or equity markets so that when they return home, they are not only self-sufficient by themselves but they can help propel our economy as well.

                <br>
                We plan to invite successful speakers and entrepreneurs to share their knowledge and experiences to help develop skills and entrepreneurship interests in students.</p>
